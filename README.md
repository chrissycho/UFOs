## Project Overview
In this module, we've learned building a web page with JavaScript through creating, populating, and dynamically filtering a table. Before getting started, We used a storyboard to design how we want our web page to look like. Then, we imported the data, which is stored in a JSON like array into a code book to build HTML table. Throughout this module, we've learned to apply traditional and arrow functions and JavaScript for loops to build dynamic tables. Finally, we built the HTML to customize the web page with Bootstrap components and CSS.

## Objectives
- Explain the strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript “standard” and JavaScript version ES6+. 
- Describe JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases. 
- Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions. 
- Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions. 
- Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop). 
- Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML.

## Summary
We've completed displaying data that is stored in a JSON like array into a table by building a table with JavaScript. With JavaScript, we added interactive function to the table such as filtering. Then, we customized our web page with nasa image on the navigation bar background, font style and size, and background theme of the page.

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, you will be finding a few key aspects of Oahu’s seasonal weather data. The investors want to ensure you’ve hit all of the key points before opening the surf shop.

### Challenge Objective
- Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.
- Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
- Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.
