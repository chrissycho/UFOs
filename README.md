## Project Overview
In this module, we've learned building a WebPage with JavaScript through creating, populating, and dynamically filtering a table. Before getting started, We used a storyboard to design how we want our WebPage to look like. Then, we imported the data, which is stored in a JSON like array into a code book to build HTML table. Throughout this module, we've learned to apply traditional and arrow functions and JavaScript for loops to build dynamic tables. Finally, we built the HTML to customize the WebPage with Bootstrap components and CSS.

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, you will be finding a few key aspects of Oahu’s seasonal weather data. The investors want to ensure you’ve hit all of the key points before opening the surf shop.

### Challenge Objective
- Determine key statistical data about the month of June.
- Determine key statistical data about the month of December.
- Compare your findings between the month of June and December.
- Make 2 or 3 recommendations for further analysis.
- Share your findings in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Challenge Summary
For the purpose of the challenge, we have determined minimum, average and maximum temperature of all stations in June and December throughout 2015-2017. We also examined the precipitation data on count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, and max precipitation across all stations in June and December through 2015-2017. We have found interesting findings (See below).

## Challenge Findings
1) Key Differences in Weather Between June and December
The statistical analysis on the precipitation weather data for June throughtout 2015 to 2017 suggests that the maximum precipitation goes down as the year increases. However, the average precipitation is around 0.12-0.2 in both June and December regardless of year. However, the average temperature throughout December is much lower than that of June regardless of year.

2) Recommendations for further analysis
Although looking at particular months is a great way to start investigating factors that might be affecting the business, I'd recommend investigating all of the months from January to December using a pie chart to see which month in general has higher precipitation percentage. I would also recommend using line graphs for temperatures throughout months for all the years so that we can easily visualize and compare three different years at the same time for each month. 

Most importantly, we need to further investigate on the sales of surfing equipment and ice cream of different stations as there are many factors contributing to the sales. We can start by looking at the profits for each store, highest month of sales, and location of the station. It is important to note that every piece of information is crucial only when we know what we are looking for. Along with the weather data, the sales data can help us decide where and when to open up the new surf and ice cream store.
